There was a man and he had eight sons.
Apart from that, he was nothing more than a comma on the page of History. It's sad, but that's all you can
say about some people. But the eight son grew up and married and had eight sons, and because there is only
one suitable profession for the eighth sons of an eighth son, he became a wizard.
And  he  became  wise  and  powerful,  or  at  any  rate  powerful,  and  wore  a  pointed  hat  and  there  it  would  have
ended...
Should have ended...
But  against  the  Lore  of  Magic  and  certainly  against  all  reason  -  except  the  reasons  of  the  heart,  which  are
warm  and  messy  and,  well,  unreasonable  -  he  
ed  the  halls  of  magic  and  fell  in  love  and  got  married,  not
necessarily in that order.
And he had seven sons, each one from the cradle at least as powerful as any wizard in the world.
And then he had an eighth son...
A wizard squared. A source of magic.
A sourcerer.
